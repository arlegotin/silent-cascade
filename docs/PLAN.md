# Silent Cascade Delivery Index

The canonical requirements live in the [design specification](superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-silent-cascade-design.md). This file is navigation only and never duplicates or overrides that specification.

| Phase | Plan | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Bootstrap | [Phase 0 implementation plan](superpowers/plans/2026-08-30-phase-0-bootstrap.md) | `uv sync --locked --group dev`, `make verify`, and `uv run silent-cascade doctor` |
| 1 — Generator and oracle | Governed by a separate plan after the Phase 0 gate | Phase 0 must pass first |
| 2 — Flow and event engine | Governed by a separate plan after the Phase 1 gate | Phase 1 must pass first |
| 3 — Neural components | Governed by a separate plan after the Phase 2 gate | Phase 2 must pass first |
| 4 — Autonomous EventFlow | Governed by a separate plan after the Phase 3 gate | Phase 3 must pass first |
| 5 — Strong baselines | Governed by a separate plan after the Phase 4 gate | Phase 4 must pass first |
| 6A — Freeze preparation | Governed by a separate plan after the Phase 5 gate | Phase 5 must pass first |
| 6B — Final runs | Governed by a separate plan after the explicit freeze checkpoint | Frozen protocol required |
| 7 — Optional showcase | Governed by a separate optional plan after Phase 6 | Scientific release path required |
